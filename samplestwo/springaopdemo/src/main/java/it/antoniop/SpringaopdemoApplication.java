/**
 * Letâ€™s spend some time understanding the AOP terminology.
 *  <ul>
 *  	<li><b>Pointcut</b>: the expression used to define when a call to a method should be intercepted.<br> 
 *  	In the example code , <code>execution(* it.antoniop.example.aop.model.*.*(..))</code>   is   a   pointcut.	
 *  
 *  	<li><b>Advice</b>: What do you want to do? An advice is the logic that you want to invoke when you intercept a method. 
 *  
 *  	<li><b>Aspect</b>: A combination of defining when you want to intercept a method call (Pointcut) and what to do (Advice) is called an Aspect.
 *  
 *  	<li><b>Join Point</b>: When the code is executed and the condition for pointcut is met, the advice is executed. The Join Point is a specific execution instance of an advice.
 *  
 *   	<li><b>Weaver</b>: Weaver is the framework that implements AOP - AspectJ or Spring AOP.
 *  </ul>
 * 
 * <hr/>
 * There are five types of advice in aspectj AOP.
 * <br>&nbsp;
 * <ul>
 * 	   <li><b>@Before</b>: Advice that executes before a join point, but which does not have the ability to prevent execution flow proceeding to the join point (unless it throws an exception).
 * 	   
 *     <li><b>@AfterReturning</b>: Advice to be executed after a join point completes normally.
 * 	   
 *     <li><b>@AfterThrowing</b>: Advice to be executed if a method exits by throwing an exception.
 * 	   
 *     <li><b>@After</b>: Advice to be executed regardless of the means by which a join point exits (normal or exceptional return).
 * 	   
 *     <li><b>@Around</b>: Advice that surrounds a join point such as a method invocation.
 * </ul>
